System Architecture Diagram:

Distribution Selection Justification:
I have decided to use the Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS as the operating system for my coursework. I have chosen this due to many reasons:
It has a long-term support - ensures the system remains secure throughout the coursework period and beyond.
It has an extensive community support - supports the network through problem solving and learning.
Debian - smaller community than Ubuntu. Ubuntu's more recent packages and superior documentation better suit learning objectives.
Fedora - less commonly used in courses and updates can sometimes break workflows.
Arch Linux - risky for time-sensitive coursework. Ubuntu is more practical.

Workstation Configuration Decision:
I have decided to use my host machine as the workstation rather than creating a separate Linux Desktop VM or using a hybrid approach. This is because:
It reduces resource consumption on my host machine.
It is a more simplified setup and maintenence.
There is also workflow effeciency - it provides immediate access to productivity tools without VM context-switching.
It develops authentic professional administration workflows.

Network Configuration Documentation:
Adapter 1: NAT
Purpose: Internet access for downloading updates and packages
How it works: The server can reach the internet, but the internet cannot reach the server
IP Address: Automatically assigned by VirtualBox (usually 10.0.2.15)
Used for: Running apt update, apt upgrade, and installing software

Adapter 2: Host-Only Network
Purpose: SSH connection from my computer to the server
How it works: Creates a private network between my computer and the server
My computer's IP: 192.168.56.1 (automatically assigned)
Server's IP: 192.168.56.10 (I set this manually during installation)
Used for: All remote administration via SSH

System specifications:
`uname`, `free`, `df -h`, `ip addr` and `lsb_release`:
