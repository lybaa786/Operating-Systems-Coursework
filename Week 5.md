Phase 5: Advanced Security and Monitoring Infrastructure

1. Implementing Access Control using AppArmo:
- AppArmor restricts the program behaviour and improves the ystem security.
- Each application has a profile that defines what it is allowed to do. These profiles control things like file access, permissions, and network use.
- AppArmor runs in either Enforce mode (blocks violations) or Complain mode (only logs them).

Step 1: Verifying AppArmor is Running by checking which system is active:

Step 2: Review Active Profiles:

Step 3: Checking SSH Profile Specifically:

OUTPUT: cat: /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.sshd: No such file or directory
This happens because Ubuntu 24.04 does not include a separate AppArmor profile for SSH by default. This is normal and does not mean SSH is insecure.

To verify that SSH is still protected: 
sudo aa-status | grep ssh

This confirms that no SSH profile is listed, which is expected on Ubuntu 24.04. SSH is still protected using other security mechanisms such as systemd hardening and kernel-level protections.

Step 4: Documenting the AppArmor Configuration:

2. Configuring automatic security updates:

Step 1: Installing Unattended-Upgrades:

3.  Configure fail2ban for enhanced intrusion detection:

Fail2ban monitors log files (/var/log/auth.log) for suspicious activity (failed SSH logins, port scans) and automatically bans offending IP addresses by adding firewall rules.

*checking the service status after downloading it(to see active (running)), creating and editing a local configuration file, saving and restarting it*:
