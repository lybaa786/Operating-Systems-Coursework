10 Most Critical Lynis Warnings:

- SSH root login enabled: This allows direct login as the root user over SSH. If compromised, an attacker gains full system control immediately. Best practice is to disable root login and use sudo.
- Firewall not enabled or not properly configured: Without an active firewall, all open services may be accessible from the network, increasing exposure to external attacks.
- Weak SSH configuration settings detected: Default SSH settings may allow insecure ciphers, protocols, or unlimited login attempts, making brute-force attacks more likely.
- Automatic security updates not enabled: Security patches are not applied automatically, leaving the system vulnerable to known exploits until manual updates are performed.
- Outdated or unnecessary services running: Services that are not required increase the system’s attack surface and may contain exploitable vulnerabilities.
- Insecure file permissions on system files: Files with overly permissive access rights can allow unauthorised users to read or modify sensitive data.
- Audit logging not fully configured: Incomplete logging reduces the ability to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents.
- Log rotation not configured: Log files may grow indefinitely, potentially filling disk space and preventing important system services from functioning correctly.
- Kernel hardening parameters not optimised (sysctl): Missing kernel security settings reduce protection against network-based and privilege escalation attacks.
- Password policy not sufficiently enforced: Weak password complexity or ageing policies increase the risk of credential compromise through guessing or brute-force attacks.

Removing unnecessary services such as CUPS reduces exposure to potential vulnerabilities and aligns the system with the principle of least privilege.
